- With the API integration of the graphics part it is fun to do. Firstly I have chosen weather API I signup for the website.
- After logging in I had to search for an API code and paste it the code in my html file.
- Then I created 3 variables weather data, temperature and description and aligned it to the center in the styling section.
- I have given the city as Cincinnati.

## Java Script code to remember the cookies.

- Firstly I have taken some time to understand the code snippet given by the professor in class.

- Later I added the function to remember the date time and display them like an alert message.
- If the user is clicking the link for the first time then the alert msg say Welcome to my homepage!
- If the user tries to log into the link once again it shows welcome back with the time and date.
- All the data of the cookie are stored in a sub strip in the java script file. This allows the browser to remember how many times the user clicked the link.
